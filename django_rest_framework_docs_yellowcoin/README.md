Rest Framework Docs (0.1.7)
===========================

Rest Framework Docs is an application built to produce an inventory
and documentation for your Django Rest Framework v2 endpoints.


Installation
------------
From pip:

    pip install django-rest-framework-docs

From the source:
- Download the tarball: <a href="dist/django-rest-framework-docs-0.1.7.tar.gz">django-rest-framework-docs-0.1.7.tar.gz</a>
- Extract files
- Run python setup.py install

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "rest_framework_docs" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:
    ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'rest_framework_docs',
        )
    ```

2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this:

```python
        url(r'^rest-api/', include('rest_framework_docs.urls')),
```

3. View /rest-api/ to see your Django Rest Framework endpoints

Requirements
-----------
- Django [1.4, 1.5]
- Django Rest Framework (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)

How it works
------------

The Django Rest Framework Docs scans your projects URL patterns for endpoints
inheriting from Django Rest Framework views. It extracts comments, variables
and methods from your code to generate documentation.
Here is what is being tracked to generate documentation:

1)  The name attribute from the URL pattern is used as the title. The following will produce a title of 'List of Countries'

```python
      url(r'^api/countries/?$', views.Countries.as_view(), name='list_of_countries'),
```

2)  The class doctsring is used as the description:

```python
    class Countries(APIView):
    """
    This text is the description for this API
    """
```

3)  The class model. (ie. User)

4)  Allowed methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

5)  Serializer properties. If your API uses a serializer, the properties are
    listed

6)  Custom parameters. It is possible to customize a parameter list for your
    API. To do so, include a key-value pair in the docstring of your API class
    delimited by two hyphens ('--'). Example: 'start_time -- The first reading':
```python
    class Countries(APIView):
        """
        This text is the description for this API
        param1 -- A first parameter
        param2 -- A second parameter
        """
```
### Customization

#### Template
Django REST Framework Docs comes with a default template which you may override.

#### Make an API
Another option is to create an API for documentation that can be consumed on a different platform (ie. mobile).

```python
        import json
        from rest_framework.response import Response
        from rest_framework.views import APIView
        from cigar_example.restapi import urls
        from rest_framework_docs.docs import DocumentationGenerator


        class ApiDocumentation(APIView):
            """
            Gets the documentation for the API endpoints
            """
            def get(self, *args, **kwargs):
                docs = DocumentationGenerator().get_docs()
                return Response(json.loads(docs))
```

#### Specify your own URL patterns
By default, Django REST Framework Docs scans all your URL patterns and extracts those which inherit from the base `rest_framework.views.APIView`. You may choose to explicitly specify which URL patterns are to be included in the documentation by providing the urlpatterns to the DocumentationGenerator constructor.

```python
    from yourproject.myapp import urls
    docs = DocumentationGenerator(urls.urlpatterns).get_docs()
```

Included Example
-----------------
Included is an example project called <a href="cigar_example/">cigar_example</a>. It contains both Model-based
and custom API views to demonstrate the different behaviours. I also included an API of the documentation,
that is, the data parsed by the generator in JSON format (api/docs).
